Notes:
1 - As part of this project we were required to make sure all of our doccuments were in one file.  Normally I make it a point not to put more than one class in a script.
2 - All 'art' and 'gui' elements were made entirely using tkinter and math (Which is why the unicorn looks incredible haha).
3 - Controls:
    - to START THE GAME: go to the bottom right and make as many players as you want (preferably between 1 and 6 more than that gets wonky).  
    - Then, roll the dice until the first human player (if any) turn starts.
    - You can buy spaces at the start of your turn (if you have enough money the buy space indicator will light up with your player color).
    - The spaces you own match your player color.  (If you are nocked out, the spaces you owned become clear).
    - Once you roll the dice your player moves, then your turn is over.
    
4 - Extra control notes:
    - Human button toggles between human and bot.
    - If you don't want to name your character the game will give your character a name for you.
    - If you don't want to pick a color, the game will pick a color for you.  
    - Color options are purple, green, red, blue, black, white, yellow, orrange, cyan, and brown.
4 - Things that were not required for this assignment include GUI elements & AI players.  Those were just extra details I added for fun :)
